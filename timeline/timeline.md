# Timeline thesis ver. 1.0

## Sep
* week 35
  - Finish structuring the data from netcdf to hdf5 onto SeaIce grid
  - Implement a custom dataloader tailored to a UNET architecture for image segmentation
  - Implement a UNET, serving as a baseline model
  
* Start writing the Theory and Methods section (Sep - Feb 2023)
  - Present the AROME Arctic model and dataset, same with Ice Charts (as a forecasting product and dataset)
  - Theory chapter which outlines the basics of image segmentation, why it is relevant for the current problem
  - UNET as a method

* week 36 - 39
  - Research relevant metrics for measuring the UNET (e.g. Sea Ice Edge "loss", IoU, etc...)
  - Research relevant modifications to the UNET architecture which can increase the accuracy
  - General model development for the rest of september

## Oct
* Research other datasets that can be relevant for validating the model performance, generate results
  - Train model on Arome Arctic reforecast
  - NextSIM for model validation

* Generate results which go beyond a baseline
* Continue model development, try to branch out model development into several individual models
* Run experiments on "finished" models, while further developing other models (Paralellize my time spent)

* Write about preliminary results
* Continue writing the methodlogy
* Finish writing the theory and dataset (Regarding basic ML, image segmentation, UNET, AROME Arctic, Ice Charts)
* Start discussing early results

## Nov
* Write discussion
* Continue writing about methodology
* Run experiments, generate results

## Des
* Write discussion
* Write methodology
* Have working code for all models, end of model development stage
* Run experiments

## Jan
* Write discussion
* Run experiments
* Send methodology to Cyril, Jean and Malte for review by end of Jan

## Feb
* Write discussion
* Send discussion chapter to Cyril, Jean and Malte by middle of Feb

## March
* If poster is going smooth, more discussion
* Prepare poster (Summarize results, research poster formatting and contents)
* 21-22-23
   - Poster-session 11th International Workshop on Sea Ice Modelling, Assimilation, Observations, Predictions and Verification

## April
* Work on loose ends discovered while working on the poster
* Start writing the conclusion and introduction
* By middle of april, send thesis to Cyril, Jean and Malte
* Revise based on feedback
* Finish introduction by April

## May
* Start of May send thesis to Cyril, Jean and Malte for second revision
* Revise revise REVISE
* Finish conclusion
* Submit thesis (15. May 2023)
